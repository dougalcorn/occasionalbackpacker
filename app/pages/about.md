title: "About the Occasional Backpacker"
---
I'm just an middle-aged guy who likes the backcountry. My day-job
involves sitting on my butt in front of a computer and dealing with
lots of people. Eventually it all gets to me and I have to escape.
If I'm lucky I've already started planning a weekend away.

I'm attracted to the backcountry because I like the quiet. I enjoy
taking in the beauty of God's creation. I also enjoy the physical
challenge of taking only what you can carry and covering a lot of
ground.

If you like, you can [email me](mailto:dougalcorn@gmail.com) or
[follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/dougalcorn). I've also got a
killer spreadsheet showing all [my gear and weights](http://bit.ly/1cYM1Bg).

If you want to go back to the beginning, you can read about how I
[got started in backpacking](/posts/getting-started-backpacking.html).
