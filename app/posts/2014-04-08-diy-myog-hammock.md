I've owned a
[Hennessy Hammock Explorer Deluxe](http://hennessyhammock.com/catalog/specs/explorer_deluxe_asym_classic/)
for about a year. It was a great way for me to get started in hammock
camping. It has everything you need for shelter and protection in one
fairly easy to use package. I originally bought an
[ENO DoubleNest](http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/DOUBLENEST.html).
It was a very comfortable hammock, but required me to add a bunch of
stuff to make it into a "complete camping system". The one thing I
miss about the ENO is to just hang the hammock and get in. The
Hennessy is more of a tent that's hanging above the ground. When
you're in it you're somewhat isolated from the outside around you.

I'm wanting to hand indoors. I think the large, tent-like structure of
the Hennessy is quite off-putting to my wife. So, I've been looking at
getting another hammock without an integrated bug net or attached
tarp. There are lots of options for commercial hammocks:

* The aforementioned ENO DoubleNest is about $65 depending on where
  you buy it. You'll also need to pick up some straps as well for
  about $30. That's pretty close to $100.

* [Grand Trunk](http://grandtrunkgoods.com) is another commercial
  venture that makes good hammocks. Their double sized hammock is $65,
  including "rope" to hang with.

* The [Warbonnet Traveler](http://www.warbonnetoutdoors.com/no-net-ridgerunners-travelers/)
  is a nice hammock made by a "cottage vendor". The 1.7 single layer
  has a weight capacity of 250 lbs. That's a little close for me, so
  I'd probably go with a double layer for more strength. That's $75,
  but includes straps.

* [Dream Hammock](http://dream-hammock.com) is another beloved cottage
  vendor that makes very nice hammocks. Their
  [FreeBird](http://www.dream-hammock.com/FreeBird.html) is highly
  customizable. A single layer hammock is $75 and a double is $115.
  That includes suspension.

* [Butt in a Sling](http://buttinasling.com) has a nice
  [camper hammock](http://buttinasling.com/bias-camper-hammock--red.html)
  that is $75 with suspension.

I know all of these are very fine hammocks. There will be slight
differences between them, but I'm sure they will all lay about the
same. My problem is I didn't want to spend $75+ on a spare hammock.

There are a bunch of [threads discussing this](https://www.hammockforums.net/forum/showthread.php?54858-Review-Tableclothsfactory-com-Hammocks), but I decided to make my
own hammock using a table cloth from
[tableclothsfactory.com](http://tableclothsfactory.com). Here's the
basics:

* [60" x 126" Chocolate Crinkle Taffeta Tablecloth](http://www.tableclothsfactory.com/Crinkle-Taffeta-Tablecloth-60x126-p/k06a_tab_crnk_60126_choc.htm) - $17.74
* [Amsteel Whoopie Slings](http://dutchwaregear.com/amsteel-whoopie-slings.html) - $16.32
* [Adjustable Structural Ridge Line](http://shop.whoopieslings.com/Adjustable-Structural-Ridge-Line-ASR.htm) - $14.50

That's a total of $48.56 delivered to my door. That's saving between
$10 and $25 from the next cheapest solutions. From a strict cash flow
perspective I'm coming out ahead. I'll also have to spend a few
dollars to buy wall anchors to hang indoors. I suppose if I wanted to,
I could have just bought a spool of Amsteel rope and done my own
whoopie slings and ridge lines. That could have saved me about $10 to
$15 additional.

However, there are a couple down sides. First, I'm making a single
layer hammock. It is very strong, but double layer hammocks have the
advantage of being able to slip a sleeping pad between the layers. I'm
not sure that matters because I'm an underquilt kind of guy.

Here's another point to consider. The table cloth hammock is
definitely heavier than the Warbonnet Traveler. For backpacking, I'm
not sure the table cloth hammock is a good choice. Making a double
layer hammock out of light weight 1.1oz Ripstop Nylon is about $40 not
including the ridge line or suspension. So really, the Warbonnet
Traveler is a great deal.

I chose to go with whoopie slings for suspension. My goal here is only
to hang indoors. My thought was that I could easily put hooks in the
wall and simply slip the whoopie slings over the hooks. If I wanted to
hang outdoors, I'd need to figure out some other type of anchoring
system. That would likely be a pair of tree straps for another $10. If
I had chosen to buy the Warbonnet Traveler, it would have come with
all the suspension needed to actually hang outdoors. It's hard to say,
the traveler is a good buy. I'm not saving that much money building it
myself.

"Knotty" has one of the better videos on
[How to Make a Gathered End Hammock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSbnQs-2y8c).
Here's another

The advantage of the table cloth is that it's already hemmed. There's
literally no sewing involved if you whip the ends.
