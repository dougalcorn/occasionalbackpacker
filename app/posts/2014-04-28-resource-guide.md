I've been asked for some good books to getting started with
backpacking. I do not consider myself an expert; however, I am the
kind of guy that likes to research lots of things. So, here's my list:

## Books

* [AWOL on the Appalachian Trail](http://amzn.com/B003JMFKRE) by David
  Miller - one of my first and better trail journals I read.
* [Ultralight Backpackin' Tips](http://amzn.com/B00D2HU5OO) by Mike
  Clelland - I'm not an ultralighter, but this is an easy to read
  guide on cutting weight
* [Allen & Mike's Really Cool Backpackin' Book](http://amzn.com/B001OI2YCO)
  by Allen O'Bannon - Similar book, broader audience.
* [The Ultimate Hang](http://amzn.com/1466263687) by Derek J Hansen -
  One of the core members of
  [HammockForums.net](http://hammockforums.net). Probably the best
  book to get for starting with hammock camping.

## Web sites

* The most important site I've found for leaning about hammock camping
  is by far [HammockForums.net](http://hammockforums.net). Yes, it's a
  crappy phpBB site and I hate it. However, the community is very
  helpful, not argumentative, and open. Lots of tips, technical
  discussions, and DIY projects. I check this site almost daily.
* I also like Derek's
  [The Ultimate Hang](http://theultimatehang.com/). He's a great
  illustrator who does a great job summarizing the material from HF.
  He's got a lot of gear reviews and compares them to DIY projects.
* An older resource, but still very good is
  [Sgt. Rock's Hiking H.Q.](http://hikinghq.net/hammock/hammock.html).
  He was one of the early backpackers that converted to hammock
  camping.

## Youtube

* First and foremost, a shout out to
  [Shug](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC27nqmEhKzD9YHK1IFwG7qA). I
  think most of us who sleep in a hammock have watched one of his
  videos. He's highly entertaining while also giving a lot of good
  information. *This is probably the best place to start learning
  about hammocks*.

## Vendors

These are some of the more popular "cottage vendors" on HF. Most of
these shops are literally one guy and his wife working as hard as they
can. The gear is designed very specifically towards light weight
hammock backpacking.

* [Warbonnet Outdoors][http://www.warbonnetoutdoors.com/] - Excellent
  hammocks. I have a Blackbird XLC and a Yeti three season underquilt.
  The WB "Superfly" and "Mambajamba" are probably the two most popular
  tarps on HF.

* [Dutchware](http://dutchwaregear.com/) - Dutch is one of the true
  innovators in gizmos for hammock camping. He makes lots of little
  titanium bits for simplifying hanging hammocks, tarps, and quilts.
  He also has good prices on DIY material and premium rope/line.

* [Hammock Gear](http://hammockgear.com/) - Excellent down quilts;
  both top and bottom. Adam also sells a very popular cuben fiber
  ultralight tarp.

* [Underground Quilts](http://www.undergroundquilts.com/) - Excellent
  down quilts. There are very little differences between UGQ and HG.
  One exception is that UGQ has an excellent order status page.

* [Butt in a sling](http://buttinasling.com/) - I've not bought any of
  their gear, but it looks good on their site. I've also heard good
  reviews on HF.

* [Dream Hammock](http://www.dream-hammock.com/) - I've also not
  bought any of their gear. I think they are becoming known as the
  "cadillac" of hammocks.

* [Arrowhead Equipment](http://www.arrowhead-equipment.com/) - One of
  the older cottage vendors. They also sell fly fishing gear. It's
  worth noting they focus primarily on synthetic quilts rather than
  down. That makes their gear a little bulkier, but also cheaper.

* [ZPacks](http://www.zpacks.com/) - These guys specialize with cuben
  fiber. Lots of super-light weight gear: tarps, rain gear, packs and
  more.

* Honorable mention goes to
  [Jacks 'R' Better](http://www.jacksrbetter.com/). I wouldn't
  classify them as "cottage". Their gear is not made to order as most
  of the above are. It's supposed to be very good gear and able to
  ship very quickly.

## DIY

* [DIY Gear Supply](http://diygearsupply.com/) - great site for both
  materials and [guides](http://diygearsupply.com/diy-guides/)

* [Thru-Hiker](http://thru-hiker.com/materials/index.php) - They have
  their own forum for DIY gear makers and a good selection of
  materials. They also have projects and articles.

Of course, there's much, much more. These are the things that came to
the top of my head in about 15 - 30 minutes of typing. As I remember
more sites worth including, I'll update.
