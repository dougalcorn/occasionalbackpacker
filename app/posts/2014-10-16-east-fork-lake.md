I took a couple of days off to hike the Backpack Trail in [East Fork
State Park](http://parks.ohiodnr.gov/eastfork). I really enjoyed this trip. It was a nearly perfect two
days in a beautiful wood. The Fall colors had not quite "peaked", but
nearly so. The Backpacking Trail is just over 8 miles in. I hiked
about 6 of it in on a Thursday, then hiked it back out the next day.
Going during the week was a real win. I didn't see a single person all
day Thursday. Even on Friday I saw more deer than people.

After some of my recent trips, I found this one pretty easy going.
There was some elevation changes, but nothing dramatic. For an Ohio
trail, there were a surprising number of switch-backs. I got the
feeling the switch-backs were added just to pad miles on the trail.
Otherwise, I think it would have been too short to be considered a
"backpacking trail." Even still, I was out of shape enough I got tired
before I reached the end. It took me about four hours to hike in and
about 3 to hike back out.

The trail itself was well maintained. At no point did I find any
obstructions. There were no treacherous sections. I did get "lost" a
couple of times. The trail I was on is shared with at one time or
another with several other trails. I found the markings to be fairly
confusing and inconsistent. It caused me to backtrack a couple times;
stop and study my map a couple times. But I was never very far from
anything. I think I could have bushwhacked my way in any direction at
any time and been "somewhere" within a few minutes.

I would imagine hiking this on the weekend would be much like my
[Zaleski trip](posts/2014-05-30-zaleski.html). The trail crossed three
or four paved park roads. There was some amount that seemed to
parallel the park roads (unlike Zaleski that seemed to parallel a
state highway). On the weekend I'd expect these roads to be busier.
The park is beautiful and quite close to Cincinnati. I can only
imagine it gets quite busy on the weekends. Thursday I saw no one.
Friday I saw seven people before lunch. Both days if I were still I
could clearly hear cars on nearby highways. That didn't really bother
me though. While I was hiking, my own coat and feet russling in the
leaves made much more noise. At night I could still hear traffic
sounds, but not enough to bother me.

The trip itself was fairly uneventful. I started on the tail at about
1pm. By 5pm I was tired and my feet hurt. I had wanted to get further
and had plenty of daylight. But I didn't see any reason to push. So I
found a nice knoll and setup my hammock off the trail. Technically
you're supposed to register for a camp site. I didn't, nor did I stay
at a designated site. This is probably my best "stealth" site yet. I
walked the trail all around my camp and could barely make it out.

After I setup camp, I thought, "I'll just rest my feet for a bit."
Laying down in the hammock was so nice I almost dozed off immediately.
It was so nice and cozy I didn't get back up until about 9am the next
morning. I didn't get up an fix dinner. I didn't get up during the
night for "business." I just layed in my hammock for about 15 hours
straight. I had high plans of doing deep thinking and reflecting.
Instead I just slept.

It's hard for me to feel bad about it though. I really enjoyed my two
days out in the woods.
